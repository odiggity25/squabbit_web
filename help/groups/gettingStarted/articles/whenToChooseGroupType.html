        <h1 class="text-center">When to choose a Tournament, League, or Club</h1>
        <p>In the Competitions tab you will find three sections: Tournaments, Leagues and Clubs. If you're not sure which type you should create for
        your group, the differences are explained below.</p>

        <h2>Tournaments</h2>
        <p>Tournaments are the core competition format in Squabbit. They can be structured in two different ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-Day Tournaments</strong>: A standalone event that takes place on a single day.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Round Tournaments</strong>: A tournament that spans multiple rounds, allowing players to compete over several days or different courses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Leagues</h2>
        <p>Leagues are designed for long-term competition across multiple events. They provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A season-long structure where players participate in several tournaments.</li>
            <li>A <strong>culminating leaderboard</strong> that tracks player performance throughout the season.</li>
            <li>The ability to schedule and manage events over weeks or months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Clubs</h2>
        <p>Clubs serve as an organizational tool for managing multiple tournaments and leagues. Think of clubs as virtual golf communities that offer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A centralized space for managing <strong>leagues and tournaments</strong> under one entity.</li>
            <li>A way to <strong>connect players</strong> who regularly compete together.</li>
            <li><strong>Administrative control</strong> over club events, allowing organizers to oversee schedules and participant engagement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Choosing the Right Option</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To host a <strong>one-time competition</strong>, create a tournament.</li>
            <li>To run a <strong>season-long</strong> competition with multiple tournaments, create a league.</li>
            <li>To manage <strong>multiple tournaments and leagues for a group of players</strong>, create a club.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Squabbit makes it easy to create and manage these formats, ensuring a great experience for both organizers and players.</p>
