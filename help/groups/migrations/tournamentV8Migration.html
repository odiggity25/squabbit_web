        <p class="text-muted" style="font-size: 0.9em;">November 3, 2024</p>
        <p>
            There are tons of new updates in the latest version including the ability to add as many formats as you want to a tournament!
            So if you want to run a multi day Ryder cup tournament with a net and gross Skins format while also running a Dots format on
            day 2, you can do that! The possibilities are endless.
        </p>

        <h2>Tournament games are now formats</h2>
        <p>
            Previously, if you wanted to add games like Skins, Dots or Two's Club to your tournament, you would add them as a 'Tournament game'.
            This was confusing because it was unclear what was a game and what was a format. Now everything is a format and you can add as many
            formats to your tournament as you want. You can even re-arrange the order of the formats by dragging on the handle beside the format
            name so that the formats appear in the order you want them to on the leaderboard.
        </p>

        <h2>Simpler settings</h2>
        <p>
            Format settings are now much simpler to find and edit. All of the format settings are now visible in one spot by tapping the format name.
            This includes settings for each round in the tournament, editing the format
            teams, setting a purse for the format and even renaming the format so it appears as you want it to on the leaderboard.
        </p>

        <h2>Change up the teams</h2>
        <p>
            Now you have the option of choosing different teams in different team formats. So if you want to run a multi day Ryder cup tournament
            while also running a Team Skins format with different teams, you can do that! You can also copy teams from one format to another if you want to run
            multiple formats with the same teams.
