        <h2>What is a press?</h2>
        <p>
            A press is simply a way of starting a new game or bet mid round. It is most commonly used when a person or team is losing the
            original game as a way to keep the remaining holes interesting. For example, let's say that Player A is playing a Matchplay
            game against Player B. After 7 holes, Player A is down by 4. At this point Player A may elect to Press, meaning they want to
            start a new Matchplay game starting on hole 8 while keeping the original Matchplay game running.
        </p>

        <h2>When can a press be used?</h2>
        <p>
            Presses can be used at any time as long as all players in the game agree. You can add a press to almost any game type in the
            app, and you can even add a press to a press! There's no limit on the number of presses you can add.

        <h2>Presses in Nassau</h2>
        <p>
            If you're playing Nassau and want to add a press, you can decide if you want the press to be for the Front/Back/Overall. To do this
            tap on the press chip (Nassau 2 P3 in the video above) and change the points accordingly. For example if you only want the press
            to count on the front 9, change the back 9 and overall points to 0.
